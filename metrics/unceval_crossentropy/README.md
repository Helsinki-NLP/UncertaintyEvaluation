# Metric Card for CrossEntropy

The cross-entropy of probability distribution p (reference) relative
to a distribution q (prediction) measure the average number of bits
lost if p is coded using a coding scheme optimized for q.

This version assumes a sampled set of q distributions, which are
averaged before comparison to the reference p.
